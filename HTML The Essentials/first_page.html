<h1>Chicken</h1>
<p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated red junglefowl species that is originally from India. They have also partially 
    hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms 
    for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, 
    and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as pets. 
    Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, 
    they are layers.

<p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion 
    in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore, and religion, 
    as well as in language and literature.

<p>Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands). In fact, chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts, chicken as a species are typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.</p>
<p>In Australian vernacular English the word chook provides the generic term for the species (e.g. "a cooked chook" or "she keeps chooks"); which enables chicken to commonly retain its original sense of a young or recently hatched bird. Chick is then rarely used to mean chicken, but is mainly used in Merriam-Webster's "Sense 1b" viz. the young of any bird.</p>
